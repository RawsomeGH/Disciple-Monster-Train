To get a keyword...

[keyword]

It just puts it in bold, really.

Icon List:

[attack]
[coin]
[ember]
[health]
[pyrehealth]

To reference a variable:

[effect0.power]
[effect1.status0.power]
[effect2.upgrade.bonusdamage]
[trait0.power]

etc.

To do a string insert of something into event text...

{0}
{1}
{2}
{[effect0.power]}
{[effect0.status0.power]}
{Card: AnnhilateRoomDamageScaling}
{Coin: 150}
{DeckReward: CardAnnihilateDuplicatorReward}
{Relic: AddAttackPerBlight}
{Reward: DelayedSpellUpgrade_Copy}
{Upgrade: UnitUpgradeStatsHealth}

etc... Only applies to events I think, not cards at least.
